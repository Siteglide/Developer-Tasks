The task is a fairly short one, which we estimate should take 1-2 hours to complete.

## The Task
As an introduction, we'd like to see how you would use React to display results from an open source API - [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/)

* Create a new React app
* The homepage should have links to 5 dog breed views (that are supported by Dog API)
* On each dog breed view (e.g. 'Labrador') you should output 3 images using Dog API
* Store your project in a public GitHub repository
